# Data Directory

This repository contains the **code only**. Operational data is stored locally and excluded from version control for security.

## Required Data Files

To run the dashboards, you need the following data files in these directories:

### `.tmp/observatory/` (History Files)
- `ado_structure.json` - Azure DevOps organization structure
- `collaboration_history.json` - Team collaboration metrics over time
- `deployment_history.json` - Deployment frequency trends
- `flow_history.json` - Lead time and cycle time metrics
- `ownership_history.json` - Code ownership distribution
- `quality_history.json` - Bug and quality metrics
- `risk_history.json` - Project risk indicators
- `security_history.json` - ArmorCode vulnerability data

### `data/` (Baseline and Tracking Files)
- `baseline.json` - Bug baseline configuration
- `armorcode_baseline.json` - Security vulnerability baseline
- `baseline_<product>.json` - Per-product baselines
- `weekly_tracking_<product>.json` - Weekly tracking data

## Generating Data Files

Data files are generated by:

1. **Security data**: `python execution/armorcode_weekly_query.py`
2. **Bug tracking data**: `python execution/ado_query_bugs.py`
3. **Dashboard generation**: GitHub Actions workflow (automated)

## Environment Variables

Configure these in your `.env` file (copy from `.env.template`):
- `ADO_ORGANIZATION_URL` - Your Azure DevOps organization
- `ARMORCODE_API_KEY` - Your ArmorCode API key
- `REPORT_RECIPIENT_EMAIL` - Email for automated reports

See `.env.template` for complete list of required environment variables.

## Security Note

Data files contain:
- Internal product names
- Vulnerability counts and severity levels
- Internal infrastructure details
- Bug tracking metrics

**These files should NEVER be committed to a public repository.**
